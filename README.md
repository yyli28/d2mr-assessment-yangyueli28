# d2mr-assessment

This is a centralized directory for D2MR mini-project assessment materials. The purpose of this repository is to provide a single location for all mini-projects, which will allow you to easily access and complete them and your instructors to efficiently grade them.

Working with this repository will help you practice using git and GitHub, which are explicit learning objectives for the course!

Dr. Dowling owns the main repository, and you will create a fork of this repository to complete your mini-projects. This will create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account that you control and can modify without affecting the main repository or being visible to other students.

# Using this repo and completing assessments {#using-repo}
 
## Setup instructions {#setup}

1. Create a fork of this repository. 
    1. Click the "Fork" button in the top right corner of this page (assuming you are viewing this on GitHub)
    2. Rename the fork by appending your CNetID: `d2mr-assessment-yourcnetid` (e.g. `d2mr-assessment-ndowling`). 
    3. Add Dr. Dowling and your section TA as collaborators to your forked repository.
2. Create an R project in RStudio and clone your forked repository to your local machine. The course website has a full guide on how to do this, but the basic steps are:
    1. In RStudio, go to File -> New Project -> Version Control -> Git
    2. Enter the URL of your forked repository (e.g. `https://github.com/nrdowling/d2mr-assessment-ndowling.git`) and click "Create Project"
    3. Because you are using a forked repository, you can pull from both your remote version of the fork or from the main "upstream" repository, but then push only to your fork, confident that you're leaving the main (public) repository untouched.
3. Periodically -- at minimum before you begin a new project -- pull changes from the main repository to your forked repository to ensure you have the most up-to-date version of the assessment materials. There are [instructions for doing this in RStudio below](#pullupstream) (it's not quite as simple as syncing with your own fork or repos).

## Completing mini-projects {#completing-projects}

Mini-projects on the menu have a corresponding directory in this repository. Each directory contains (or will contain) either a README.md file with general instructions for approaching the project *or* a Quarto notebook (e.g., cleaning-level-1.qmd) that will guide you through completing the more structured projects.

Before submitting, you'll need to add a copy of the [assessment.md](assessment.md) file (found here in this top-level directory) to the project directory and complete it. This file will be used to assess your work.

### Project types

Mini-projects will mostly fall into one of the following categories: guided exercises, open-ended projects, or off-the-menu projects. The [menu overview](#menu-overview) below discusses these in more detail, but here's a quick summary of the mechanics for completing and submitting them:

### Guided exercises

These projects will have a Quarto notebook that will guide you through the project, like leveled data cleaning exercises. The notebook will include instructions, code snippets, and explanations to help you complete the project. Unless otherwise stated, all aspects of the project should complete these projects in the Quarto notebook.

### Open-ended projects

These projects will have a README.md file that will provide a general description of the project and some guidance on how to approach it. Provided it is sensible to do so, you will put your work in that same directory, in whatever form it takes.

In some cases it's won't make sense (or even be possible) to complete the project in the directory of your centralized assessment repo. For example, mini-projects that require some kind of "publication" (like a website or Quarto APA manuscript) will need to exist in their own dedicated repositories; they can't run as sub-directories of this one. 

In those cases, you should still add and complete an [assessment.md](assessment.md) file in the associated project directory (here in this centralized repo), which will include any necessary information about how to access your work. 

### Off-the-menu projects {#otm-projects}

You can also design your own "off-the-menu" projects. To do so, create a new directory in the repository, name it appropriately, and add a copy of the [otm-proposal.md](otm-proposal.md) file from this directory. Instructions for completing and submitting the proposal via Canvas are included in that document. 

Once approved, you can start working on the project. When you submit your finished project, you'll follow the same process as the on-the-menu projects, but you'll be resubmitting to the same assignment on Canvas that you submitted your proposal to.

## Submitting mini-projects {#submitting}

When you finish a mini-project, you should complete the [assessment.md](assessment.md) file in the project subdirectory, then submit a link to that subdirectory on Canvas.

**No matter what kind of project it is (structured, open-ended, or off-the-menu), the project needs a directory here in this repo, and that directory needs to include a completed [assessment.md](assessment.md) file.**

Submit to any one of your 10 mini-project assignments on Canvas (whichever the next open one is, doesn't matter as long as it's not one you've already used). The Canvas assignment is simply a text box where you should include:

1. The name of the project and/or a brief description of the project
2. A link to the subdirectory for your mini-project
    1. If you completed the project in a separate repository, your [assessment.md](assessment.md) file in the subdirectory should explain how to access your work.
3. Any additional info you'd like your grader to know

Your grader will access the directory you've linked to, review your work, and provide feedback in the [assessment.md](assessment.md) file. Once the assessment is complete, your grader will push the file back to your repository, and your Canvas assignment submission will be marked "complete." 


### Pulling from the main (upstream) repository {#pullupstream}

You should periodically pull changes from the main repository to your forked repository to ensure you have the most up-to-date version of the assessment materials. Unfortunately RStudio doesn't have a nice easy button to click for this, so you'll need to do it from the terminal pane in RStudio.

Before the first time you pull from main, you need to tell git where the main repository is. You only need to do this once. In the terminal pane (not the R console) in RStudio, run the following command:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/nrdowling/d2mr-assessment.git
```

Now you can pull changes from the main repository by running:

```bash
git pull upstream main
```

You may get the following message:

```
hint: You have divergent branches and need to specify how to reconcile them.
hint: You can do so by running one of the following commands sometime before
hint: your next pull:
hint: 
hint:   git config pull.rebase false  # merge
hint:   git config pull.rebase true   # rebase
hint:   git config pull.ff only       # fast-forward only
hint: 
hint: You can replace "git config" with "git config --global" to set a default
hint: preference for all repositories. You can also pass --rebase, --no-rebase,
hint: or --ff-only on the command line to override the configured default per
hint: invocation.
```

If you get this message and you understand all those options, you can make up your mind about what to do next. If this is jibberish to you, just run the following command:

```bash
git config pull.rebase false
```

Now try the `git pull upstream main` again. This time it should work, but you'll get pulled into a text editor to write a commit message. You have 2 options:

1. Just close the text editor (it's probably vim) by typing `:q` and hitting enter. This is quick and dirty and not ideal, but since you know you'll never need to merge your fork back to main, it's fine in this context.
2. Write a commit message. This is the "right" way to do it, but it's a bit more complicated. If you try to just start typing, you won't see anything happen. That's because you're in "command mode" in vim. If you want to do this:
    1. Hit 'i' to enter 'i'nsert mode.
    2. Type your commit message.
    3. Hit `esc` to exit insert mode.
    4. Type `:wq` and hit enter to save and close the text editor.

Granted, both these assume your machine is using vim (or similar) as a text editor. If that doesn't work, your machine is probably using something other than vim. On PCs it's probably nano. You can try `ctrl+x` to exit, and then `y` to save changes and `enter` to confirm. Still not working? Bust out your troubleshooting workflow. Google is your friend.

Have you hit an impassable wall with pulling from the upstream repo? It's ok. This isn't a major learning objective for the class. You can also do this outside of RStudio with apps designed for GitHub integration, like GitHub Desktop. I'll leave it to you to figure out how to do that.

# Mini-project menu overview {#menu-overview}

Earn up to 40 points across all mini-projects for meeting course objectives, and an additional 10 for engagement. 

**These projects do not have strict submission or grading requirements.** You can make any mini-project as simple or as complex as you like. If you write a `hello_world()` function that's 5 lines long, that's fine, but you'll probably only be able to demonstrate a couple of the learning objectives. If you write a `hello_world()` function that's 50 lines long, or write multiple functions and build them into your own package, you'll probably be able to demonstrate a whole lot more than that. The complexity you aim for can matter for engagement points. That 5-line `hello_world()` function might not earn any engagement points, while the 50-line one could earn you all 10.

This goes for the structured guided exercises as well, like the leveled data cleaning exercises. The Level 1 exercises are designed to be relatively simple and straightforward, while the Level 2 exercises are more complex and open-ended, but you can complicate a Level 1 and simplify a Level 2 as much as you like. You're assessed on demonstrating the objectives and engagement, not on following the directions of the exercise to the letter.

Some projects are marked as "off the syllabus" (OtS). These are opportunities to learn and demonstrate skills that aren't explicitly covered in the course. These will let you showcase the skills we do explicitly cover in a different context, or let you explore something that interests you.

You are welcome to go "off the menu" (OtM) to design your own mini-project that lets you focus on your interests while still demonstrating the course objectives. If you choose to do this, you should submit a proposal for approval using the [otm-proposal.md](otm-proposal.md) file in this directory. Instructions for completing and submitting the proposal are in the same document.

### Mini-project menu {#project-menu}

This is the structure of this repository. Second-level directories group projects by the category of skills they assess (mosty; expect a LOT of overlap!). Third-level directories are individual projects.

Materials for mini-projects (either a simple readme with general instructions or guided content with a .qmd) will be added to their respective subdirectories as we progress through the quarter, but you may complete projects before the materials are added. 

Projects may be added or revised throughout the quarter, so be sure to keep you fork up-to-date with the main repository.

**Tags:**

1. **(GE):** This is a semi-structured guided exercise with a .qmd notebook to guide you through the project. These typically have both a "Level 1" and "Level 2" version, with the latter being more complex and offering less guidance.
2. **(DEMO)**: This is not a mini-project, but a demonstration of the skills you'll need to complete the related mini-project. There is nothing to complete, and you should not submit these for grading.
